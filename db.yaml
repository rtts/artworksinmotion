    The official video for the recorded version of "This Too Shall Pass" off the album
    "Of the Blue Colour of the Sky". The video was filmed in a two story warehouse,
    in the Echo Park neighborhood of Los Angeles, CA. The machine was designed and
    built by the band, along with members of <a href="http://syynlabs.com/">Syyn Labs</a>
    over the course of several months.

    There is an in-depth behind-the-scenes look at the warehouse <a href="http://www.okgo.net/this-too-shall-pass-rube-goldberg-machine/">here</a>.

    media sensation, following the release of his ''Bathtub'' series of short films,
    that transformed both iconic and familiar Sydney scenes into miniature wonderlands.
    Known as the pioneer of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tilt-shift_miniature_faking">tilt-shift</a>
    / <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timelapse">time-lapse</a> technique, Loutit
    was the first to recognize how time and focus combine to support the powerful
    illusion of miniaturization in film. In his scaled down and sped up realities,
    real world subjects become their miniature counterparts. Boats bob like toys in
    a bathtub, cars race like slot-cars, and crowds march as toy armies. Loutit''s
    aim is create a sense of wonder in our surroundings by "challenging people''s
    perceptions of scale, and helping the viewer to distance themselves from places
    they know well".
