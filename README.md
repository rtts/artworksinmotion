# Artworks in Motion

Artworks in Motion is a collection of artistic videos, curated by Return to the Source. This repository contains the current database (`db.yaml`) of visual artworks and the code that automatically publishes them as a Youtube playlist using the [gdata API](https://code.google.com/p/google-gdata/). There is also a CGI implementation for submitting videos and reviewing submissions. However, the code has been cleaned from any usernames, passwords and API keys, so you will have to supply your own if you want to start your own Artworks in Motion website.

The current collection of videos can be viewed at [www.artworksinmotion.com](http://www.artworksinmotion.com/).
